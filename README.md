## Notes

After the five hours I was told not to take, the calculator has basic functionality.
It turns out that I actually was not terribly familiar with how React Redux works without thunks.
I learned a great deal in the making of this program.

As I continue to debug, the calculator was steadily improved.
However, to continue even further would likely be outside the spirit of a two-hour effort.

This project is quite excellent; I think that, should my job search continue past the holidays, I will be polishing up this calculator and putting it in my portfolio with high priority thereafter.

Perhaps I should have, instead of mimicking an actual four-function calculator, have separated the inputs into the following flow: number then operation then number then execute. That would have massively reduced the web of possible input sequences at the cost of not mimicking a four-function calculator.

Should my job search end in success, I will likely polish up the calculator and put it into my portfolio with low priority thereafter.

Thank you for the opportunity to do this project. Attempting to plan for all possible button presses and combinations, attempting to foolproof it against user shenanigans, was an enjoyable learning experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
